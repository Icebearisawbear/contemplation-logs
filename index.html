      Contemplation log 1
    </h1>
    <hr>
    <p class="gloria">
      This is the first time i have ever made a contemplation log, it is very fun doing this, i get to type alot and doing something that makes it even better, coding! This is the also the first day of my vacation as of the 8/19/24. I just learnt that on Windows. Having small icons causes the date to not show in the taskbar.

    <h1 class="gloria">Stage 1: Boredom</h1>
    <hr>
    <p class="gloria">
      I’m going to be honest, I have no idea what I’m really typing here. My thoughts are scattered, and boredom has taken over, so I’m just letting the words flow out in an attempt to pass the time. Right now, I’m listening to music, which helps a little. Specifically, I’ve got the "Soft Pop List" playing in the background, a playlist curated by my best friends, including Zach and Rhy. It’s a comforting collection of songs that we’ve all contributed to over time, and it’s become our go-to soundtrack for moments like this. The playlist has grown pretty extensive, with a whopping 506 songs on it. It’s kind of amazing how many tracks we’ve gathered together, each one carrying memories or inside jokes that only we would understand.
    </p>
    <p class="gloria">
      This morning started off with a jolt—literally. I was woken up by the sound of my dad drilling a new shelf into my parents’ room. The noise was loud, sharp, and impossible to ignore. It sucked, to put it mildly, and all I wanted was to roll over and go back to sleep. I tried to ignore it at first, burying my head under the pillow, but the relentless drilling made that impossible. Eventually, though, I managed to drift back to sleep, despite the noise, and ended up sleeping for almost five more hours.
    </p>
    <p class="gloria">
      When I finally woke up again, the house was quiet—eerily so. My parents had already left for work, leaving me home alone for the day. The silence felt strange after the chaos of the morning, a stark contrast that was almost unsettling. There’s something about being alone in the house that can feel both liberating and isolating at the same time. On one hand, I had the entire place to myself, free to do whatever I wanted without anyone around to bother me. But on the other hand, the absence of any human activity made the house feel empty, almost too quiet.
    </p>
    <p class="gloria">
      I wandered around for a bit, trying to shake off the lingering grogginess from my extended sleep. The day stretched out before me, with nothing in particular to do and no one around to talk to. That’s probably why I ended up here, sitting at my desk, typing away aimlessly, trying to fill the void with words. The music helps keep me grounded, at least a little. Each song on the playlist brings with it a different vibe, a different memory, and for a while, I can lose myself in the melodies and lyrics, letting them drown out the quietness of the house.
    </p>
    <p class="gloria">
      But no matter how many songs play, or how many words I type, the boredom still lingers, gnawing at the edges of my mind. It’s one of those days where time seems to crawl, where every minute feels like an hour, and I’m just trying to get through it without completely losing my mind. I know that eventually, the day will end, my parents will come home, and the house will be filled with life again. But until then, I’m here, typing without direction, trying to make sense of my thoughts, and hoping that something—anything—will come along to break the monotony.

      Stage 2: Acceptance
    </h1>
    <hr>
    <p class="gloria">
      At this point in time, I find myself trying to shift my perspective, attempting to make the best out of this unexpected break from my computer. The music playing in the background helps—I'm vibing to the rhythm, letting it wash over me and carry me away from the frustration that's been building up inside. I've been telling myself that this forced hiatus might actually be a blessing in disguise, a chance to do things I wouldn't normally prioritize when I'm glued to my PC.
    </p>
    <p class="gloria">
      I keep reminding myself that without the constant distraction of my computer, I have more time to focus on things that are equally important, if not more so. For instance, I can work out more, pushing myself physically in ways I often neglect when I'm caught up in the digital world. The idea of getting stronger, healthier, feels like a positive trade-off, something that will benefit me long after this break is over.
    </p>
    <p class="gloria">
      Then there's the opportunity to gain more common sense, to spend time reflecting on life in a way that's harder to do when I'm lost in games or endlessly browsing the web. I tell myself that maybe this is a chance to mature a bit, to grow in ways that aren't tied to a screen. The thought of learning new skills, like coding, also crosses my mind. Without my usual distractions, I have the time to dive deeper into programming, to understand the intricacies of code that I've only skimmed the surface of before. It's a challenge, but one that could be rewarding if I commit to it.
    </p>
    <p class="gloria">
      And of course, there’s the idea of having more fun, but in different, perhaps more meaningful ways. I imagine engaging in activities that I might have overlooked, like reading a book, going for a walk, or even just spending more quality time with my family. There's a part of me that sees this as an opportunity to rediscover the joys of a simpler, more grounded life.
    </p>
    <p class="gloria">
      Yet, as the clock ticks on, and the day begins to fade, my resolve wavers a bit. By 5:37 PM, the mood shifts as I find myself listening to XXXTENTACION, his raw, emotional lyrics resonating with the complex feelings swirling within me. The music is both a comfort and a reminder of the darker, more intense emotions I’m grappling with. It’s like the soundtrack to my inner turmoil, a mix of acceptance and resistance as I try to make peace with this situation.
    </p>
    <p class="gloria">
      As I sit here, letting the music fill the space around me, I'm also acutely aware of the silence that accompanies it. I’m waiting for my mother to arrive, her presence something I’m looking forward to, more than I realized. Knowing she'll be home soon brings a sense of comfort, a reminder that I’m not completely alone in this. Her arrival will break the monotony, give me someone to talk to, and maybe, just maybe, help me see the positives in this forced break with a little more clarity.
    </p>
    <p class="gloria">
      So, here I am, caught between the beats of the music and the ticking of the clock, trying to convince myself that this time away from my computer is good for me, even as I feel the pull of old habits and familiar routines. It’s a strange mix of emotions—hopeful one moment, frustrated the next—but I’m trying to embrace it all, knowing that eventually, this too shall pass.

    <h1 class="gloria">
      Stage 3: Insanity
    </h1>
    <hr>
    <p class="gloria">
      Slowly, I find myself sinking deeper into this chair, my body growing heavier with each passing minute as I continue to type my life away into this computer. The rhythmic tapping of the keys is almost hypnotic, a steady beat that echoes in the otherwise silent room. Each letter, each word, takes shape on the screen, pixel by pixel, forming sentences that feel both meaningless and profoundly significant at the same time. As the words spill out, they seem to mirror the monotony of my thoughts, looping endlessly like a broken record.
    </p>
    <p class="gloria">
      The more I type, the more I feel the edges of my sanity beginning to fray. The repetition, the stillness, the isolation—it's all starting to take its toll. I feel like I'm trapped in a cage of my own making, where the only escape is to keep typing, to keep putting my thoughts into words, even though it feels like it's slowly driving me mad. The screen in front of me is both a window to my mind and a prison that I can't break free from.
    </p>
    <p class="gloria">
      Eventually, the frustration becomes too much to bear. My emotions, which I've been trying so hard to keep in check, start to bubble over. I can feel the anger rising, the sense of helplessness tightening its grip around my chest. And then, without warning, it all explodes. I lash out, punching the wall beside me, the impact sending a jolt of pain through my fist. But even that doesn't bring the relief I desperately crave. Instead, it only amplifies the chaos inside me.
    </p>
    <p class="gloria">
      I can feel the tears welling up, but I choke them back, refusing to let them fall. Crying feels like giving in, like admitting defeat, and I can't afford that right now. So instead, I cry on the inside, my emotions swirling in a storm that threatens to consume me whole. The boredom is unbearable, a suffocating force that makes every second stretch out into an eternity. I can feel myself slipping, my mind starting to unravel as I sink further into this endless routine.
    </p>
    <p class="gloria">
      And then, just like that, I find myself back at the beginning—Stage 1, square one, whatever you want to call it. It's like I'm stuck in some twisted time loop, doomed to repeat the same cycle over and over again. No matter how much I try to break free, I always end up right back where I started, sitting in this chair, typing out my life, contemplating every choice I've ever made.
    </p>
    <p class="gloria">
      It’s maddening, this endless loop of self-reflection and frustration, and yet I can’t seem to stop it. I keep hoping that maybe, this time, something will change—that I'll finally find a way out of this cycle. But each time I return to the beginning, it feels like another piece of me gets chipped away, leaving me more tired, more drained, and more lost than before.

    <h1 class="gloria">
      Stage 4: Exasperation
    </h1>
    <hr>
    <p class="gloria">
      I'm feeling a surge of anger towards my mom right now, even though I know deep down that I shouldn't be. She's only looking out for me, doing what she thinks is best, but it's hard to see it that way when I'm caught up in my frustration. The situation feels unfair, especially since she expects me to accept that I can't use my PC for the last two weeks of my vacation—a time that was supposed to be for relaxing and doing what I enjoy. The moment she took my computer away, it felt like a door had slammed shut on my freedom. 
    </p>
    <p class="gloria">
      Now, I'm left with nothing but my thoughts and this HTML document. It’s strange how something so simple has become my only outlet, a place where I can let out all the emotions swirling inside me. I find myself typing away, the words spilling out onto the screen, driven by whatever I'm feeling in that moment—sometimes it's anger, sometimes it's a fleeting bit of happiness. But mostly, it’s just me contemplating everything, trying to make sense of it all.
    </p>
    <p class="gloria">
      This document has become a strange sort of diary, a place where I pour out unhealthy amounts of overthinking, analyzing every little detail of what's happening, trying to justify my feelings, even when I know they're not entirely rational. It's like I'm stuck in this loop, going over the same thoughts again and again, trying to find some kind of resolution that never really comes.
    </p>
    <p class="gloria">
      The more I type, the more I realize that this isn't just about losing access to my computer. It's about feeling powerless, about having something I care about taken away without a say in the matter. It's frustrating, and while I know my mom is doing this because she cares, it’s hard to reconcile that with how upset I am. So, I keep typing, hoping that maybe, by the time I reach the end of this document, I’ll have found a way to make peace with it all. But for now, it’s just me, my thoughts, and this endless stream of words on a screen.

      Stage 5: Mother has arrived
    </h1>
    <hr>
    <p class="gloria">
      When my mother finally arrived home, it caught me off guard. I had been so deeply immersed in what felt like an eternity of endless typing, my fingers dancing across the keyboard, that I hadn’t even noticed how much time had passed. The sudden realization that she was home pulled me from my digital world, and I eagerly got up from my chair, stretching muscles that had grown stiff from hours of sitting. As I stood, I took a moment to look out the window, the sunlight streaming in and casting a warm, golden glow across the room. It was a brief but welcome reminder of the world beyond the screen—a world that I had almost forgotten in my focused haze.
    </p>
    <p class="gloria">
      With renewed energy, I made my way downstairs, eager to greet her and offer my help. As I stepped outside, the fresh air hit me, invigorating me even more. There she was, just getting out of the car, and I could see the familiar smile on her face as she saw me approach. I hurried over to her, ready to assist. She had four bags with her, each one serving a different purpose. Two of them were filled with towels she planned to wash later today, the other two contained her lunch bag and her purse.
    </p>
    <p class="gloria">
      I took the bags from her hands, feeling the weight of them but glad to be doing something that wasn’t typing. The towels were soft and bulky, while her lunch bag had the faint scent of the food she’d enjoyed earlier in the day. Her purse, as always, was a bit heavier than it looked, likely filled with all the essentials she never left the house without. I carefully balanced everything in my arms, making sure not to drop anything as we headed back inside.
    </p>
    <p class="gloria">
      As we walked together up the stairs, I felt a sense of relief wash over me. The house, which had been so quiet and empty all day, suddenly felt alive again with her presence. I realized just how much I had missed having someone to talk to, someone to share the day with. For hours, it had just been me and the computer, a silent companion that offered no conversation, no warmth. But now, with my mother home, that loneliness dissipated, replaced by the comforting knowledge that I wasn’t alone anymore.
    </p>
    <p class="gloria">
      When we reached the top of the stairs, I set the bags down and turned to her, a genuine smile spreading across my face. It wasn’t just the relief of having someone to help me break the monotony of the day—it was the simple joy of having her back home, of knowing that for the rest of the evening, I would have her company. It was a small thing, perhaps, but in that moment, it meant the world to me.

      Stage 6: The anticipation
    </h1>
    <hr>
    <p class="gloria">
      At 6:43 PM, the clock seemed to tick slower than usual as my mother and I sat in quiet anticipation, waiting for my father to arrive. The hunger gnawed at us both, a relentless ache that made every passing minute feel like an hour. The evening air was thick with the scent of dusk, but all we could think about was the promise of a meal that would finally satiate our growing thirst for food.
    </p>
    <p class="gloria">
      My mother, ever the thoughtful one, was deep in contemplation, her mind racing through the possibilities of what she could prepare for dinner. Her gaze occasionally drifted to the kitchen, where pots and pans stood ready, as if they too were waiting for my father's arrival to spring into action. She knew that whatever she made needed to be hearty enough to quell the hunger we were both feeling but also comforting enough to bring a sense of warmth to the end of a long day.
    </p>
    <p class="gloria">
      As we waited, the sounds of the late artist XXXTENTACION filled the room, his voice a backdrop to our shared silence. The music, raw and emotional, seemed to resonate with the hunger that churned in my belly. The beats and lyrics seemed to mirror the restless anticipation that hung in the air, each note echoing the growl of my stomach as it reminded me just how long it had been since my last meal.
    </p>
    <p class="gloria">
      I could feel the tension building, not just from the hunger but from the waiting itself. Every car that passed by outside made me glance towards the door, hoping it would be my father finally coming home. The wait was torturous, the kind that made you count every second, but there was nothing to do but sit and endure it.
    </p>
    <p class="gloria">
      My mother, ever composed, finally rose from her seat and made her way to the kitchen. Even though my father had yet to arrive, she began preparing the meal, her movements deliberate and measured. The sound of chopping vegetables and the sizzle of oil in the pan began to fill the room, a hopeful sign that relief was on the way.
    </p>
    <p class="gloria">
      And still, I waited, the music playing on, my thoughts consumed by the twin desires for food and for the comfort of having our family together again, even if just for dinner. The hunger and the wait were powerful forces, but the promise of what was to come kept me going, my anticipation growing with each passing moment.

    Stage 7: Work  
    </h1>
    <hr>
    <p class="gloria">
      When my dad got home, we immediately set to work on trying to fix our malfunctioning freezer. The issue was more complicated than we initially thought, and as we struggled to figure out what was wrong, the ice and all the frozen goods inside the freezer started to melt. It was a frustrating and time-consuming process, with ice water pooling everywhere as we tried different solutions. Eventually, after what felt like hours of trial and error, we managed to get the freezer working again, but not before most of the contents had already started to thaw.
    </p>
    <p class="gloria">
      After all that effort, I decided to take a short break, just a couple of minutes to catch my breath. Then, feeling a bit more at ease, I walked into my mother's room. I knew my best friend, Zach, was eager to play some games before he left for his trip to Florida, and I really wanted to join him. So, I mustered up the courage to ask my mom if I could use my computer, hoping she'd make an exception just this once. However, despite my best efforts to convince her, she remained firm in her decision and didn't want to go back on her word. It was disappointing, but I had to accept her decision, even though it meant missing out on time with Zach.

      Stage 7: Conclusion
    </h1>
    <hr>
    <p class="gloria">
      As the day draws to a close and the clock strikes 11:11 PM, I find myself reflecting on everything that happened today. I've managed to complete all the tasks I set out to do, which gives me a sense of accomplishment. This day stands out as it was the first one spent at home without my PC, a situation that initially felt like being in solitary confinement. The absence of my PC was a constant reminder of how much I rely on it, and at times, it felt like I was cut off from the outside world.
    </p>
    <p class="gloria">
      Yet, despite this challenge, today turned out to be unexpectedly memorable. The time I spent with my parents, engaging in different activities, brought a unique kind of enjoyment that I didn’t anticipate. From working together to fix the freezer to sharing moments of laughter and conversation, the day was filled with small but meaningful experiences that made it special. Instead of feeling isolated, I felt more connected to my family, and that made the day not only bearable but genuinely enjoyable. In the end, today was a day I’ll remember fondly, filled with moments that made me appreciate the simple joys of being with family, even without my usual distractions.
